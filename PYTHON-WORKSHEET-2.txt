11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary. 

A. LIST:
   a. List is a ordered collection of items.
   b. Lists are Mutable.
   c. Items in the list can be replaced or changed.
B. Set:
   a. Set is an unordered collection of items.
   b. Sets are Immutable.
   c. Items in the set cannot be replaced or changed.
C. Dictionary:
   a. Dictionary is an unordered collection of sets.
   b. Dictionaries are Mutable.
   c. Dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position.
D. Tuple:
   a. Tuple is a ordered collection of items.
   b. Tuples are Immutable.
   c. Items in the set cannot be replaced or changed.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+
with space in python. 
Strings are Immutable.

>>> string="I+Love+Python"
>>> str_new = string.replace("+"," ")
>>> print(str_new)
I Love Python

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting 
the datatype of a variable in python. 

ord(): It is a function which returns the number representing the unicode of a specified character.
Example: 
>>> a=ord("A")
>>> print(a)
65

>>> def datatype(a):
	print(type(a))

	
>>> datatype("Python")
<class 'str'>
